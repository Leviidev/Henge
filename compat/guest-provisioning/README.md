# On-device guest provisioning

This directory is an incomplete step toward automatic Sonoma compatibility
installation. No production code currently mounts or modifies a guest disk.

The TrollStore package builds and signs `henge-root-helper` from `root_helper.c`
and adds `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` and
`com.apple.private.persona-mgmt` to the app signature. Ordinary IPA packages omit
the helper and these additions. These entitlements and the persona 99 / UID 0 /
GID 0 launch mechanism follow [TrollStore's root-helper documentation](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore#root-helpers).
The app does not request `platform-application`, which has additional IOKit and
container-access consequences. Whether these permissions suffice in Henge's
application context still requires qualification on the matching iPad.

At launch, Henge runs a read-only `probe-v1` on a background queue. The helper
accepts no paths or other operations. It reports real/effective user and group
identity and whether Apple's image attachment and APFS mount tools are
executable. It never opens a guest image or creates a mountpoint. The launcher
checks all persona setup results, closes unrelated inherited descriptors,
supplies a fixed environment, bounds output to 4095 bytes and kills/reaps a
helper that does not complete within three seconds. Valid root identity is
required before it logs a successful capability report. A failed or absent probe
does not prevent normal VM use.

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/compat -p test_root_helper.py -v`
exercises the native launcher with **test-only persona stubs**. It covers protocol
rejection, unsuccessful exit, signals, excessive output, missing/nonexecutable
helpers, denied persona setup, inherited environment/descriptors and timeout
cleanup. These controls do not establish iPad root permissions.

The separate `tools/compat/audit_guest_disk_mount.py` developer control proved
read/write attachment of an authored scratch APFS image on the iPad, including
marker persistence after a read-only remount and detach while holding an inode
lease. It used root SSH, not this application helper. Actual Sonoma Data-volume
selection, encrypted volumes, source-built payload delivery, rollback and guest
activation remain unimplemented. VM disk ownership locking excludes cooperating
concurrent writers; it does not make editing a disk behind suspended guest RAM
safe. Provisioning must not mutate a paused VM's backing image.
